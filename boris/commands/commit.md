# Smart Commit

1. Run verification first (`/verify`)
2. Show `git status` and `git diff --stat`
3. Generate conventional commit message (feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore)
4. Ask for confirmation before committing
5. Do NOT push unless explicitly requested

## Conventional Commit Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| feat | New feature |
| fix | Bug fix |
| docs | Documentation |
| refactor | Code restructuring |
| test | Tests |
| chore | Maintenance |
