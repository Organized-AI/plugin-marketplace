## 🔧 Technical Architecture Details

### Event Deduplication Logic

```
SCENARIO: User submits lead form

1. Browser Pixel fires:
   {
     event_name: "Lead",
     event_id: "lead_12345_abc",
     event_time: 1699012345,
     user_data: {
       fbp: "fb.1.xxx",
       fbc: "fb.1.yyy"
     }
   }

2. Server (CAPI) fires:
   {
     event_name: "Lead",
     event_id: "lead_12345_abc",  ← SAME ID!
     event_time: 1699012345,      ← SAME TIMESTAMP!
     user_data: {
       em: "hashed_email",
       ph: "hashed_phone",
       fn: "hashed_name",
       fbp: "fb.1.xxx",
       fbc: "fb.1.yyy",
       external_id: "crm_54321"
     }
   }

3. Meta's Deduplication:
   - Sees matching event_id
   - Keeps CAPI version (richer data)
   - Credits both sources
   - Result: 1 lead counted, best quality data

4. If Browser Blocked:
   - Only CAPI event received
   - No deduplication needed
   - Lead still counted
   - Attribution preserved!
